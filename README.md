# email-automation-gpt-bluefolder
This project automates email processing by fetching unread Gmail threads, extracting and categorizing the latest messages, and sending intelligent replies using OpenAI embeddings and a vector store (FAISS or Chroma). It uses threading and deduplication to handle large volumes efficiently while preserving conversation context.
